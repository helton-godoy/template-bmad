# Introduction to BMAD Translator

Welcome to the **production environment** of the BMAD Translation System.
This demonstration validates our commitment to **precision** and **cultural adaptation**.

## Technical Precision

The system uses advanced content protection.
For example, the frontmatter `status: in_progress` must remain exactly as is.
Technical terms like `workflow`, `framework`, and `setup` should be preserved.

## Cultural Adaptation (pt-BR)

The system is configured to target **Brazilian Portuguese**.
It should correctly handle grammar nuances, such as:

- "The file was saved" -> "O arquivo foi salvo" (not "O ficheiro").
- "We are testing" -> "Estamos testando" (using proper aspect).

### Code Example

```python
def production_run():
    print("System is ready!")
```

Let's verify if the translation honors the house rules!
